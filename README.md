# Accelerate-Python-codes-using-proper-libraries
This powerpoint slides given in this repository demostrate how to accelerate python codes using some libraries. 
In particular, Just-In-Time compilation is used for acceleration. 
More investigations will be made soon and the investigation results will be uploaded here for share. 


********Note***********


bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2021-03-31.csv  is too big (over 25 MB) 
Github does not allow it to be uploaded. 
all other files except tips.csv are also over 25 MB. 
Two machine learning algorithms: Linear regression and Generalized Linear Regression
are used for analyses of two CSV datasets.
Conclusion: the Generalized Linear Regression outperforms the Linear Regression in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Investigations on the differences between Panadas and PySpark. 


All datasets can be requested for you to download. Please email me and leave me an message.
