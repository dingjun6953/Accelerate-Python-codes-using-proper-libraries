# Accelerate-Python-codes-using-proper-libraries
This powerpoint slides demostrate how to accelerate python codes using some libraries. 
In particular, Just-In-Time compilation is used for acceleration. 
More investigations will be made soon and the investigation results will be uploaded here for share. 


********Note***********
bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2021-03-31.csv  is too big (over 25 MB) 
Github does not allow it to be uploaded. 
all other files except tips.csv are also over 25 MB. 
Two machine learning algorithms: Linear regression and Generalized Linear Regression
are used for analyses of two CSV datasets.
Conclusion: the Generalized Linear Regression outperforms the Linear Regression in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Investigations on the differences between Panadas and PySpark.
